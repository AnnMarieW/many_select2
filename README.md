## Development
### Getting Started

1. Create a new python environment:
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   ```
   _Note: venv\Scripts\activate for windows_

2. Install python dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install npm packages:
   1. Optional: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node version:
      ```shell
      nvm install
      nvm use
      ```
   2. Install:
      ```shell
      npm install
      ```
4. Build:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```


### Create a production build and publish:

1. Clean up build and  dist - removes old and temp tarballs:
```
rm -rf dist build
```


2. Run a new build
```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Build source distribution.  
```
npm run dist
```

4. Test your tarball by copying it into a new environment and installing it locally, for example:
```
pip install <your-project-name-version>.tar.gz
```

Note:  For local install, use:

```
pip install -e ./path-to-project
```


5. Publish on PyPI

Prepare release on the GitHub UI - For more information see [Managing Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
When in doubt, do an alpha release first
```
$ twine upload dist/*
```
6. If publish on npm:

Note: Publishing your component to NPM will make the JavaScript bundles available on the unpkg CDN. By default, Dash serves the component library's CSS and JS locally, but if you choose to publish the package to NPM you can set `serve_locally` to `False` and you may see faster load times.
```
npm publish
``` 


### Justfile

1. Create a Python environment from previous step 1 and install:
   ```shell

   ```
2. Build
   ```shell
   just build
   ```
3. Publish
   ```shell
   just publish
   ```
4. See all commands with `just -l`
